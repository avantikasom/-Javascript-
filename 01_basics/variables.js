const accountId = 234;
let accountHolderName = "Avantika";
var accountCity = "Meerut";// It is suggested that not to use var due to problem of scope and functional block.
accountBranch = "gandhi ashram";// it is also allowed in javascript but not a good practice.

console.table([accountId, accountHolderName, accountCity, accountBranch])// console.table allows us to print the multiple values at once in a table format.
